1. **What is the DOM?**
    - Create an HTML page with various elements (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists, images) and then open the Developer Tools in the browser to explore the DOM structure.
    
    Use the following HTML skeleton, we've added some HTML elements so you can play with them.
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My exercises</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
        <button id="my_button">Change this background color</button>
        
    
        <h3>Groceries</h3>
        <ul id="list_container">
            <li class="list_element">One</li>
            <li class="list_element">Two</li>
            <li class="list_element">Three</li>
            <li class="list_element">Four</li>
        </ul>
        <input type="text"  id="new_element_text" />
        <button>Add element</button>
    
        <img src="http://imagedummy.com" />
        <button>Click me to change image</button>
    
    </body>
    
    <script>
        // your scripts go here
    </script>
    
    </html>
    ```
    
2. **Node Types**
